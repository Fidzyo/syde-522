* Machine Intelligence

** Lecture 1: January 3rd

*** Difference between?
- AI (Animal intelligence)
- ML (Part of AI that works)
- MI (ML + Fuzzy + Evolution)
- CI (FNNs + Fuzzy + Evolution)

*** What is AI?
- We promised GPC (General Problem Solver)
- But could not deliver.

*** Four points in learning
- Think Humanly
- Think Rationally
- Acting Humanly
- Acting Rationally (this is ML)

*** What is intelligence?

*Turing Test*: Alan Turing

Watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wLqsRLvV-c

The M-IQ is proportional to the time that takes for the judge to find out which
room is operated by computer.

*Chinese Room*: John Searle

*** What is intelligent?
Example: Tic-Tac-Toe

- *Solutions 1*: Hand wired (look-up table)
  - Simple and efficient
  - Not intelligent

- *Solution 2*: Some if-else rule to play
  - Still not intelligent

- *Solution 3*: ML solution
  - Represent the state of the game.
    - Current board positions
    - Next legal positions
  - Use evaluation function
  - rate the next move (how likely to win)
  - Look ahead for possible opponent's moves

** Issues of ML?

Keep in mind that machine learning is just *function approximation*. However, we
cannot see that function.

1. What algorithm can approximate my function?
2. How much training data do I need?
3. How complex is the problem?
4. Do you have noise in the data?
5. What are the limits of learn-ability? What can be learned and what cannot be
   learned?
6. Can prior knowledge help?
7. What representation does really fit my data?

** Terminology

1. *Data*
   - Visual
   - Symbols
   - Audio
   - Text
2. *Preporcessing*
   - Filtering
   - Normalization
   - Outlier detection
   - Dimensionality reduction
3. *Features (attributes)*
   - Data representation
     1. Hand-crafted features (e.g., SIFT)
     2. Automatically extracted features (e.g., CNN)
4. *Encoding*
   - Compressing Data
     1. Conventional (PCA, Fisher vectors)
     2. ML (autoencoders, t-SNE)
